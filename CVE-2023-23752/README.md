# Joomla CVE-2023-23752 Scanner

## Description

This script detects the version of Joomla CMS by analyzing the /language/en-GB/install.xml file. It also checks for a specific vulnerability (CVE-2023-23752) that exists in Joomla versions 4.0.0 to 4.2.7.

The user can provide a custom Joomla directory path using the --joomla-dir option. The default Joomla directory path is /joomla. The script defines two functions: detect_joomla_version() and check_cve_2023_23752_vuln(). The detect_joomla_version() function takes the host IP address, port number, and Joomla directory path as arguments, and sends an HTTP GET request to the /language/en-GB/install.xml file to get the Joomla version number. The function then returns the version number if it is found in the response body.

The check_cve_2023_23752_vuln() function also takes the host IP address, port number, and Joomla directory path as arguments, and sends an HTTP GET request to the same file. The function then checks if the version number is between 4.0.0 and 4.2.7 (inclusive), and returns true if the vulnerability is present and false otherwise.

The action() function is executed when the script is run. It calls the detect_joomla_version() function to get the Joomla version number and saves it in the version variable. If the version number is found, the function checks if the CVE-2023-23752 vulnerability is present by calling the check_cve_2023_23752_vuln() function. If the vulnerability is present, the function sends an HTTP GET request to /api/index.php/v1/config/application?public=true and extracts the username, password, and database from the response body using the extract_info() function. The function then prints a message with the Joomla version number and the extracted user, password, and database information if they are found.


## Usage

Example usage: `nmap -p80 --script CVE-2023-23752.nse --script-args joomla-dir=/customdir`

Note: The custom directory path should start with a forward slash ("/")
Example: `--script-args joomla-dir=/myjoomladir`
Do not use spaces in the directory path.
